## Internet of things in healthcare: applications, benefits, and challenges 
The healthcare industry is in a state of great despair. Healthcare services are costlier than ever, global population is aging and the number of chronic diseases are on a rise.

IoT enables healthcare professionals to be more watchful and connect with the patients proactively. ... IoT devices tagged with sensors are used for tracking real time location of medical equipment like wheelchairs, defibrillators, nebulizers, oxygen pumps and other monitoring equipment.
What we are approaching is a world where basic healthcare would become out of reach to most people, a large section of society would go unproductive owing to old age and people would be more prone to chronic disease.

Isn’t it the end of the world we suspected? Whatever, IoT app development is at your rescue.

While technology can’t stop the population from ageing or eradicate chronic diseases at once, it can at least make healthcare easier on a pocket and in term of accessibility.

Medical diagnostic consumes a large part of hospital bills. Technology can move the routines of medical checks from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient’s home (home-centric).

The right diagnosis will also lessen the need of hospitalization.

A new paradigm, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has an extensive applicability in numerous areas, including healthcare.
